To run the project you have to keep all the files into tha same directory and then just run the epoch.py file and it will run all the other modules which will prduce the train and test accuracy with the following combination of the regularization techniques:

Train and Test accuracy with just Batch Normalisation only.
Train and Test accuracy with with Batch Normalisation and L1 regularization.
Train and Test accuracy with just L1 regularization.
Train and Test accuracy with just L2 regularization.
Train and Test accuracy with Batch Normalization and L2 regularization.
Train and Test accuracy with no Batch Normalization no L1 regularization and no L2 regularization.
Train and Test accuracy with Batch Normalisation and L1 regularization and L2 regularization.

You need to insatll the following dependencies:

Pytorch
Tqdm
matplotlib
